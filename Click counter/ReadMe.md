This is my first "project" in JavaScript. It simply counts how many times a person can click in 1-10 seconds. Also, it finds the minimum time between all clicks, and then it calculates the best result if you every time clicked that fast. I uploaded it because it's fun to look at it and because it is my reference point how much progress did I make.
